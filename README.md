# .net-gpu-testbed

Simple testbed project to tinker with OpenCL and OpenGL via OpenTK library under .Net
Sadly there is almost no docummentation related to the OpenCL in .Net world, so this project mostly uses C++ tutorials.

Mostly as a learning tool with two goals:
  * learn a bit about GPU programming and OpenGL
  * get used to working with pointers and unsafe context in .Net
